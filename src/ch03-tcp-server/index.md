# Building a TCP Server

You've made it through the theory, and I promise it wasn't just for show. Understanding the OSI model, TCP/IP, sockets, and handshakes gives you the mental model you need to actually build something real. And that's exactly what we're going to do now.

Think of building a TCP server like opening up a small shop. You need to:

1. **Set up shop** - Find a location (bind to an address and port)
2. **Open the doors** - Start listening for customers (clients)
3. **Greet each customer** - Accept incoming connections
4. **Have a conversation** - Read what they want and write back a response
5. **Handle problems gracefully** - Deal with customers who leave abruptly or say confusing things

The beautiful thing about Rust is that its standard library gives us everything we need to do this. You don't need external dependencies or fancy frameworks to write a working TCP server. The `std::net` module contains all the building blocks.

In this chapter, we're going to write an **echo server** from scratch. An echo server is the "Hello, World!" of network programmingâ€”it listens for connections, reads whatever data the client sends, and echoes it right back. Simple, but it demonstrates every fundamental concept you need to understand: binding, listening, accepting, reading, and writing over TCP.

Think of it like a practice conversation where someone repeats everything you say. Annoying in real life, perfect for learning networking.

Once you understand how this works at the socket level, HTTP servers won't seem mysterious anymore. They're just TCP servers that happen to speak a specific text-based protocol. But first, let's get comfortable with the raw TCP part by building something that actually works.
